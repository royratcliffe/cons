# Add custom commands for code coverage analysis. Enable lcov and genhtml if
# they are found. Only enable code coverage analysis for Debug build type, as it
# is typically used for development and testing. Code coverage analysis can add
# overhead to the build and runtime, so it is generally not recommended for
# Release builds.
#
# If lcov is found, add the coverage compiler and linker flags to enable code
# coverage analysis.
#
# Note that find_program will return the path to the executable if found, or
# NOTFOUND if not found. It will also cache the result, so subsequent calls will
# return the cached value. This allows us to check if lcov is available and
# conditionally add code coverage targets.
